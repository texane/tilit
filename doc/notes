[ image distance function ]
currently, each indexed image is associated with the per channel average color, making
3 dimensions. for each pixel in the source image, the indexed image which reduce the
euclidian distance is chosen. using rgb works in practice but it can lead to bad
results: as an example, a tricolor red green blue flag may have a white average, and
will be chosen for the white pixel.

potential solutions include:
. switching from rgb to another representation domain (yuv)
. using a density metric: as an image is being indexed, use the relative difference
instead of the actual channel value. this may be equivalent to use another color
representation, to investigate.
